    Woke up this morning to the news that I too have been impacted by the layoffs DoorDash. As I am sure you all can imagine this comes as a major shock.I loved my time at DoorDash. I had planned to stay with this company the long haul. I couldn't have said enough good things about the recruiting organization and especially the #Labs team. This was the greatest group of people I have had the honor to work with and I am so disappointed it ended early. With all of that being said I am officially #opentowork.

    It was about 11:20 pm last night and I was working late preparing for calibrations as I wanted to represent my team to the best of my ability. It was also my first calibration at Doordash because I recently joined after being at Meta for almost 6 years. Then my access to a doc expired. I didn‚Äôt think much and simply re requested access and continued to work for another 5 mins and then I was logged out of my zoom account. Then my computer shut down. I thought this was a sign I might be over preparing and it was time for bed. But my laptop restarted and I saw that I was locked out by my administrator and needed a pin. Quickly I tried to email tech support with a screenshot and then knew something horrible may have happened as my work email rejected. I tried not to panic and wake my wife up and I had no one to reach out to this late. Then I simply prayed for peace and tried my best to fall asleep but couldn‚Äôt. I woke up to an email saying my role was eliminated due to etc etc. So many emotions I am trying to process still as my 3 young children will be waking up soon and the morning madness begins. I knew the risk when I took this role and would not have tenure which probably meant security and stability if mass layoffs happened. It‚Äôs still so tough to come to grips with as I‚Äôve been trying my best to actively help former Meta colleagues as much as I can. My brief time at Doordash was great and believed I was making strong momentum with my team and client groups right away. I will miss working with them. I know (at least a little) the market conditions are brutal for tech recruiting let alone recruiting managers. To all who have been impacted my blessings to you and your family.

"    As a past startup founder, I know firsthand how hard it can be to recruit and hire the right talent‚ÄîAnd after going through my first layoff experience this year, I've been thinking a lot about how companies hire. In my newest thought piece for A.Team's MISSION, I explore a new model for bringing in talent to accelerate product development while cutting fixed costs: fractional teams. Read the full article at the link below to find out: Why Fractional Teams Are the Secret to Layoff-Proof Hiring in 2023  ",             Content strategist // Tech and culture writer // Brand builder // Digital Marketer // Startup Founder         ,0,0,0
"    Imagine that instead of painstakingly hiring one individual at a time, you were able to hire an entire team‚Äîflexibly scaling their hours up and down based on the stage of product development you‚Äôre in.Wait‚Ä¶ Did we just figure out a layoff-proof model for team building?Here‚Äôs the predicament: Slower growth, higher interest rates, and diminished consumer spending are forcing companies to exercise a lot more caution as they undergo their 2023 headcount planning‚Äîbut they still need to build high-growth products to hit their goals.What if they designed their companies differently?Despite the current economic climate, top founders are bringing in the talent they need to accelerate product development while actually saving on costs.The secret? Instead of hiring full-time, they‚Äôre deploying fractional teams.With fractional hiring, founders can deploy a specialized, fractional team that‚Äôs already worked together before and is perfectly suited to build what they need to build, instead of painstakingly hiring individuals and forming them into a team over a 6-12 month period.If you look at the layoff messaging from the CEOs of Stripe, Meta, and Apple, they all had a common narrative: They‚Äôd gotten ahead of themselves with hiring amidst the economic boom and grew their workforce too fast.If they had instead kept a smaller core staff of FTEs and supplemented them with fractional teams based on the initiatives at hand‚Äîwould the outcomes be different?Fractional teams might just be the answer to layoff-proof hiring in 2023.Read the full article: https://bit.ly/3UjUszo  ",             Certified Resume Writer - ATS | 1637+ Resumes Delivered -Globally | 400+ LinkedIn Profiles Optimized | Job Search Strategy | Clients Land their Job Interviews after my Resume Writing | Content Creator | Personal Branding         ,982,             115 comments           ,                 54 reposts

"    Shame on DoorDash for laying people off via email. I know they laid off a lot of people, but at least set up some Zoom meetings or something. Treat people like people.I've been thinking a lot about how many people worked hard for their employers prior to being laid off. They put in the extra hours, pushed through days packed with meetings, logged in on weekends to meet deadlines and push out offers; they rose to challenges, stepping outside their comfort zones and learning the skills needed to get the job done, and to think that after all of that, no one ""had time"" to break the news to their face?

"    More layoffs are coming, and here‚Äôs one thing you can do to reduce your anxiety. In 2012, I took a year-long break from work. I wanted to try something new. So, I left a high-paying job without one in hand. I could do this because of one reason. I'd built an investment portfolio that gave me income and could withstand market ups and downs. I want to teach you how to do that (I spent 20+ years on Wall Street). Most people have lost too much money this year. 2023 is likely going to be volatile as well.

Jassy said that Amazon was still assessing how buyers are reacting to the current environment, but that it was ""clear (that) consumers are spending but being careful.""‚ô¶Ô∏è He also addressed the controversy around the¬†Kyrie Irving-boosted book and film¬†Hebrews to Negroes: Wake up Black America, confirming that it¬†would remain for sale on¬†Amazon, saying that moderating content for sale on Amazon ‚Äúis one of the trickiest issues we deal with‚Äù and calling it a ""very slippery slope"" to make such calls ""when you have content whose primary purpose is not to espouse hate or ascribe negative characteristics to people.""‚ô¶Ô∏è Jassy seemed bullish on Amazon's long-term emerging tech bets, including Zoox, its self-driving car and Project Kuiper, its¬†initiative to provide low-latency, high-speed broadband connectivity: ""Do I think every single one of them is gonna be successful? The history of business ‚Äî¬†the history of Amazon ‚Äî¬†suggests no... But even one of them actually becomes that fourth pillar on top of Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, then we're a different company.""#TechonLinkedIn #DealBookSummit  ",             Trust & Safety Recruiting @ DoorDash         ,129,             6 comments           ,                 2 reposts

"    David just escaped from a full-time job in a toxic environment where the best employees quit and the worst people were promoted to management positions. The people with all the ideas were shunned and pushed aside, while the tush-kissers with no plans got promoted.¬†¬†The harder David worked, the worse he got treated. Finally, when a completely unqualified person got promoted to be his manager because that manager had a personal relationship with one of the VPs, that was the last straw; David resigned. It was hard for him to leave the company he worked so hard for, but he felt a huge weight lifted off his shoulders the minute he was out of there.¬†I read this story from Liz Ryan‚Äôs article in Forbes, and it is so reminiscent of many people‚Äôs experiences in many organizations worldwide.

In 2022, the economy slammed on the brakes.Many of these layoffs are a consequence of over-leveraged companies ‚Äì high salaries, high operating costs, and poor business planning from when the economy was hunky dory.But there are lots of companies out there that put away food for the winter and are still doing pretty well.

With the news today that another 20% of the company was terminated, I wanted to share a few things that helped me. üí¨ Sought external advice and perspectives: The day after, I Googled ""What to do after a layoff"", and came across so many good resources, articles, and podcasts that helped me shift the narrative in my head and take things less personally. One that I found particularly inspiring: https://lnkd.in/gyy6xBys üå≥ Tended to my mind, body, and soul: For me, this looked like: hiking, yoga, calls with friends and family, journaling, volunteering and getting more active in my community. These activities helped me stay in the present instead of spiraling and ruminating.ü§ù Nurtured existing professional relationships: I took this outreach in my own hands to say goodbye to ex-coworkers I had enjoyed working with. Quite a few folks didn't even know that I had been let go, and were immediately supportive. I ultimately left these conversations feeling like I had some closure and that I had made a positive impact, regardless of the unfortunate outcome.üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Created new relationships: Set up coffee dates and attended a few networking events with the intention to just get out there and keep the momentum going.

"    A gente dedica tanto tempo a se desenvolver tecnicamente que √†s vezes esquece de algo igualmente importante: fazer amigos no trabalho. Eu sei que muita gente diz que ""n√£o t√° aqui pra fazer amigos, t√° aqui pra trabalhar"". Mas, olha, se for pra passar 8h por dia com a minha equipe, eu quero, sim, ser amiga do povo. Eu quero saber como eles t√£o, eu quero ajudar e ser ajudada por eles, eu quero rir junto, eu quero reclamar junto, eu quero ir pro bar e pro cinema, quero apresentar meu marido e conhecer a fam√≠lia deles. Eu quero me sentir bem perto deles e quero que eles se sintam bem perto de mim.Minha empresa passou por layoff h√° alguns meses, depois insolv√™ncia e, por fim, fal√™ncia, recentemente. Tantas coisas dif√≠ceis aconteceram. Durante esse tempo, teve momentos em que a gente n√£o tinha certeza se/quanto o sal√°rio ia atrasar. Alguns n√£o tinham nenhuma reserva financeira (morar na gringa tem dessas coisas), outros n√£o sabiam quanto tempo poderiam ficar no pa√≠s legalmente at√© conseguirem um novo emprego. Os estrangeiros, particularmente, sofreram com informa√ß√µes desencontradas, dif√≠ceis de entender; regras, muitas vezes absolutamente inflex√≠veis, que n√£o t√£o na internet e precisam ser discutidas em alem√£o com algum √≥rg√£o do governo; prazos extremamente apertados; exig√™ncias de pap√©is e mais pap√©is.Mas, ja dizia o ditado, quem tem um amigo tem tudo. Quando a gente t√° longe da fam√≠lia e de toda nossa rede de seguran√ßa, s√£o os amigos do trabalho quem mant√™m a gente de p√© (e aqui, eu queria estender isso tamb√©m pros amigos que fiz no LinkedIn). Durante todo esse caos, eu tive o prazer de ver e viver as demonstra√ß√µes de carinho mais lindas. Gente oferecendo dinheiro emprestado pra quem n√£o tinha reservas financeiras (!!); oferecendo o endere√ßo postal pra quem tava fora do pa√≠s (na Alemanha, n√£o ler uma carta pode ter repercuss√µes s√©rias); ajudando a galera a se recolocar e fazendo recomenda√ß√µes; se oferecendo pra acompanhar nas visitas a √≥rg√£os do governo pra fazer tradu√ß√£o; e muitas mais atitudes incr√≠veis que nem cabem nesse post. Que prazer enorme √© saber que, apesar de o trabalho ter acabado, esses amigos v√£o ficar nas nossas vidas. Que a gente ainda vai rir muito juntos, vai pro bar, vai mandar memes, vai acompanhar o desenvolvimento um do outro, vai poder ajudar e vai ter pra quem pedir ajuda quando apertar. Essa fam√≠lia longe de casa foi, definitivamente, a melhor coisa que a Alemanha me trouxe. E eu contei tudo isso pra deixar aqui meus dois centavos: desenvolva relacionamentos genu√≠nos no trabalho (em qualquer lugar, na verdade).

"    There is risk with joining a start-up, one that I knew when leaving my previous position with a stable, privately-owned company earlier this year.  Unfortunately, my time at the start-up came to an early end due to layoffs.  I made a quick decision to go to the #gnydm this week to network and hopefully uncover some opportunities.  One question I was asked a lot, ""What do you want to do next?"" With so many types of organizations, development of new roles and changing market dynamics, I can't answer that easily or quickly.  But what I do know is this:1. I love building teams and I have learned from all the rock-stars that I've had the opportunity to manage in the past.2. Marketing is my wheelhouse, but I love being engaged in sales and partner opportunities and helping put all the collective pieces together within an organization.3.  I thrive when the work I am doing can positively impact an organization's growth or reformation.4.  Start-ups aren't ruled out, I will just seek to be better informed if another opportunity presents itself.5.  Dental has been my world most of the past 13 years, but it's not my only interest.  Purpose-driven organizations are my jam.6.  Culture is Queen!  If you value your employees and support them and their journey, the organization wins.  During my time off I will look forward to my time at home with my family, especially during the holidays.

"    *200 years ago it was coal, 100 years ago it was oil, today it is Data that defines geopolitics (and investments).*Let me talk to you about the trigger for this post, Movistar's Devils series, particularly season 2. A little synopsis: London, 2016. Massimo Ruggero is now CEO and, with new COO Wu Zhi, has made huge profits for NYL's Chinese shareholders. However, the polling data on the Brexit referendum threatens total disaster. Taking advantage of the situation, Dominic returns and asks Massimo to join him in a new global war between the West and China for control of world data. Massimo will have to decide whose side he is on in a life-threatening battle that will lead to a showdown in 2020, amid the pandemic.Therefore, we see that the behavior of the East and the West are destined to control the input of the 4th industrial revolution, Data. And whoever can generate, manage, model, and monetize the data faster will have an economic, political (or probably social) advantage, confirming a long-cycle Kondratiev process. This game has been defined several decades ago, and today it could be at the climax of its process.For this reason, in Dominic's words, investments should be focused on Data's M&A processes. Because, in this scenario, companies are only the support of that Data. Those that best generate and manage differentiated data will be the determinants of value in the 21st century.#data #china #investments #oil #Eest #West #geopolitics #Kondratiev #finance #mergers¬†#acquisitions  ","             UTM whisperer.

"    HR Leaders have become the dumping ground for the collective angst from the company. They insulate the CEO and other leaders from the emotional intensity. Many have propped up the mood  colleagues and managed to wear a lot of the burden of pandemic and post-pandemic plans on their shoulders. It fascinates me that they kept it together so well - but is there a breaking point of this pressure?What if HR quits? What if after playing referee between team members, assisting people with going on stress leave, and listening to complaint after complaint, they say screw it - I'm outta here? Companies would struggle. As I coach/consult leaders who are responsible for the HR function - I'm curious if people understood the toll it's taken if they would change their approach. Food for thought in my article - please have a read and hug your HR person! (k, maybe hugging is no longer politically correct. a simple thank you will do.)  #hr #humanresources #people #leadership #personalgrowth #ceo #leaders   ",             782 followers         ,19,0,0
